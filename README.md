# sensor-data-analysis-system

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a system designed to collect, process, and analyze sensor data. It utilizes a three-tiered architecture: C++ for sensor interaction and data preprocessing, Ballerina for data ingestion and service management, and Python for data analysis and visualization. This project aims to provide a platform for students to learn about IoT data pipelines, distributed systems, and data science concepts
